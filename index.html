        <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a
          year’s
          appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of
          known physics.</p>
        <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
          the Big Bang.
          Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic
          evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the
          universe to swell
          faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
        <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
          not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
          Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
        <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
          Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>
        <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole,
          a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
          in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
          violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
          long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
          correct.</p>

        <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether
          it could ever be proved.</p>
        <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
          dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space
          and energy to science and speculation.</p>
        <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
          hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture
          and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes
          bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
        <h4>
          ‘As Big as It Gets’
        </h4>
        <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
          reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would
          be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general
          relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
        <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
          “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
        <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
          waves.”</p>
        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
          space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
          sun.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
          Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
          here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
